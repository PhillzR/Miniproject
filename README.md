**Project Name:** Garfield ...but worse

## Overview of the Game:
I have chosen to try to somewhat replicate the Garfield game. The premise of the original game is you play as Garfield and have to clean up the house before Jon gets home, otherwise you won't get lasagna. You have a vaccum to vacuum up objects and blow them out on their right places again, that's the core loop of the game - and what i'll focus on. 

**Game features:** 
* Player 
* Camera 
* Objects to vacuum 
* GUI to see vacuumed objects 
* Visual effect (shadergraph shader) to show where the objects should be placed 
* Enemy: Odie that follows the player around and is occasionally annoying by walking into you 

### Project Parts:
